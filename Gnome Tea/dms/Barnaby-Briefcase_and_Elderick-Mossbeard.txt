Barnaby Briefcase: Psst, Elderick! Just rolled up my trousers — spotted a ring of button mushrooms near Mrs. Thistlewick's begonias in the Dosis Neighborhood. Fancy a midnight mushroom tea and moon-gazing?
Elderick Mossbeard: Moon-gazing sounds splendid, Barnaby! But rumor has it Percival Puddlefoot taught the mushrooms to whistle; I heard tiny tunes carried on the dew at dawn.
Barnaby Briefcase: Whistling mushrooms! Imagine a garden orchestra. I'll bring chamomile and my tiny umbrella; you bring your whistle-proof pocket mirror. Maybe invite Dotty and her snoring snail — she still owes us dance lessons.
Elderick Mossbeard: Dotty's snail snore could double as percussion and keep the fireflies in rhythm. I'll fetch the lanterns (battery of beetles optional). Also, discreetly warn Mrs. Thistlewick: her begonias practiced samba this morning.
Barnaby Briefcase: Perfect — beetle batteries and a samba alert on Mrs. Thistlewick. Meet at the dew-station by the stone gnome post at moonrise. If the mushrooms start whistling, we'll start the Polka of Petunias!
