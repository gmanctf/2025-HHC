Reggie Reggae: Hey Flex! Dosis Neighborhood is glowing — caught the dew doing the cha-cha on the hostas. Fancy a moon-gazing sesh by the mushroom ring tonight? I hear Mabel Mudfoot is bringing glow-worm jelly.
Flex Muscle: Yo Reggie! Count me in — I'll carry the portable pebble bench (right after a quick kettlebell squat with a watering can). Did you hear about Sir Sprout's scandal? He painted his hat neon and blamed the snails.
Reggie Reggae: No way! Neon hat scandal 🍄😂 I heard Gloria Glove tried to start a compost choir. They only sing in worm-soprano. Also, bring a blanket — dew's extra jazzy tonight.
Flex Muscle: Blanket secured. Also, I practiced my 'moss massage' technique for the neighbors. If the moon's full we can host a tiny midnight mushroom dance-off. I'll demo the 'spore shuffle.'
Reggie Reggae: Perfect plan. I'll bring chamomile tea and a ukulele (low tide, high vibes). Meet at the old watering-hose arch at moonrise. If the daisies gossip too loudly we'll bribe them with seeds.
