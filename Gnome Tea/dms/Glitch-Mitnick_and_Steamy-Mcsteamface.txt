Glitch Mitnick: Psst, Steamy — witnessed Marigold Moonbeam trying to teach the snails to waltz under the dew by the hydrangeas. One snail kept stepping on a mushroom cap and apologizing. You see that kind of choreography often in Dosis?
Steamy Mcsteamface: Only every third blue moon! I saw Old Sprig yesterday turning his hat into a mushroom feeder — said he wanted the toadstools to RSVP for moon-gazing. Speaking of, are we still on for midnight tea and starglass by the compost heap?
Glitch Mitnick: Absolutely. I'll bring the peppermint dew-tea and a jar of glow-worms for ambiance. Maybe we can invite the snails as chief dancers and ask Marigold to judge. Also, remind Pebble to not bring his foghorn kettle (last time we mistook the moon for a zucchini).
Steamy Mcsteamface: Ha! No foghorn this time, promise. I'll bring the gentle steam kettle (low puff only) and a stack of fairy biscuits. If the dew makes our hats soggy we'll do the moon-gazing hatless and hum to the mushrooms instead.
Glitch Mitnick: Perfect — meet behind the thimble bench at midnight. Bring an umbrella-lantern and your best hummable tune. See you under the moon, Steamy — don't forget your dancing shoes (or shell polish)!
