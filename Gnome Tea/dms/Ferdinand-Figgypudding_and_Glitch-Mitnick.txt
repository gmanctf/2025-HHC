Ferdinand Figgypudding: Phew! Found a ring of glow-mushrooms by the old watering can. They smell like lemon dew. Want to meet later for moon-gazing and a mushroom tea?
Glitch Mitnick: Oh ho! Tell the truth: did you borrow Petunia Puddlehat's tiny lantern again? If you bring the lantern, I'll bring the marshmallow beetles for toasting. Also—gossip—Bramble snored so loud last night the snails wore earplugs.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Guilty as charged! Lantern is polished with nettle oil. Marshmallow beetles? Brilliant. We'll listen for Bramble's snore-symphony and name constellations after radishes.
Glitch Mitnick: Perfect. Also propose a dew-harvesting contest at dawn — winner gets a silver thimble and a crown of clover. I heard Mallow's trying to teach the mushrooms to waltz.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Sold! I'll bring the clover crown and a pocket-sized tune for the mushrooms. Meet at the third toadstool from the pond, when the moon ticks like a teapot.
