Elderick Mossbeard: Pip! Spotted a ring of moonlit mushrooms by the compost heap — they look like tiny umbrellas. Also, did you see Greta Thistlehat's new hat? It has a thistle so large a snail nearly moved in.
Pip Sparkletoes: Oh ho! I did see the hat, and the snail left a polite calling card (a shimmering trail, naturally). The mushrooms were humming a lullaby at dawn — must be the dew. Fancy a midnight moon-gazing picnic under the bluebell arch?
Elderick Mossbeard: Midnight moon-gazing! I'll bring glow-moss tea and mushroom biscuits. Rumor has it Crispin Nettlewhistle is practising fox-whistles nearby, so we'll have music. Shall we invite Grumbleberry or keep it a cheeky two-gnome caper?
Pip Sparkletoes: Invite Grumbleberry but only if he promises not to challenge the toads to a croak-off. I'll bring my dew-catcher and a jar of sparkly thyme for sprinkling. Also, bring a tiny lantern — moonlight sometimes makes the mushrooms shy.
Elderick Mossbeard: Deal. Lantern, glow-moss tea, mushroom biscuits, and a stern warning to any competitive toads. Meet you at the bluebell arch when the moon tiptoes over the hollyhocks. Don't forget your sparkly socks!
