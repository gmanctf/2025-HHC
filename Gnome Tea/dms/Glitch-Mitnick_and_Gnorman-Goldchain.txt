Glitch Mitnick: Morning from the dew-drenched corner of Dosis! Woke up to a choir of tiny mushrooms humming under Mrs. Petunia Prankle's hydrangea — thought of you. Fancy a moon-gazing picnic tonight?
Gnorman Goldchain: Absolutely! My gold chain will catch the moonlight and attract fashionable fireflies. Also — rumor has it Sir Sproutsworth commissioned a topiary shaped like a teapot. Scandalous or brilliant?
Glitch Mitnick: Teapot topiary = brilliant. Mushrooms might start a union if they see tea service. I'll bring dew-sip (it's basically coffee for gnomes) and Snickles' kaleidoscope. We should stealth past Mr. Muddlepots though; his snoring causes windstorms.
Gnorman Goldchain: Good call. Meet at the old toadstool bench at midnight. I'll bring tiny lanterns, acorn biscuits, and a spare gold tassel in case the moon wants to borrow bling.
Glitch Mitnick: Perfect — see you under the moon and mushrooms. P.S. If the daisies start gossiping, hand them a biscuit and they'll sing the alphabet backwards.
