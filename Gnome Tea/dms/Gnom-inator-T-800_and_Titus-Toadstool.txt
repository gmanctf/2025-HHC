Gnom-inator T-800: Good morning, Titus Toadstool of Dosis Neighborhood. Dew levels at 07:00: 87% — optimal for moon-gazing and damp-hat polishing. Initiating plan: nightly moon party by the old blue toadstool. Will you bring the mushroom lanterns?
Titus Toadstool: Delighted! I brought my finest mushroom lanterns (hand-knitted by Mabel Mallow — yes, she rearranged the moss again). Also rumor: Percy Peony is teaching the snails to waltz. Very scandalous for a Tuesday.
Gnom-inator T-800: Scanning scandal… waltzing snails noted. I will recalibrate my hat reflector to boost moonbeams for their debut. Reminder: collect dew cups at sunset for punch. Avoid the north patch — last time the mushrooms staged a meeting and refused to glow.
Titus Toadstool: Perfect. I'll recruit the frog choir for background crooning and hide a few glittering pebbles for a mushroom-hunt. Meet by the crooked rake at dusk — unless Sprig Jarhead volunteers his umbrella as a stage again.
Gnom-inator T-800: Acknowledged. Deploying reflective watering can and two spoons for ceremonial stirring. If Sprig brings the umbrella, I will perform a polite yet firm tickle on any object that snickers (slugs included). See you under the moonlit caps.
Titus Toadstool: Brilliant! Bring extra dew and your best 'I-am-stone' face for the paparazzi mushrooms. Moon-gazing, gossip, and giggles at the blue toadstool — it's a plan. See you at dusk, friend.
