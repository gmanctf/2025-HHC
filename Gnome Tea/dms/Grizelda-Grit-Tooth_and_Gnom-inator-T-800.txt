Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Psst, T-800! Caught Old Thimbletoes practicing moon-gazing with a colander last night. Think he's starting a constellation for mystery mushrooms?
Gnom-inator T-800: Affirmative, Grizelda. Colander improves starlight drainage by approximately 23%. I also inspected dew patterns — Thimbletoes is mapping secret puddles to attract glow-moss. Shall we stage a midnight tea ceremony to join him?
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Midnight tea sounds divine! I'll bring chamomile from the east bed and a biscuit timer (it's a snail with a ribbon). Also, rumor: Petunia Puddlewhisk swapped her hat for a toadstool beret. Fashion emergency or avant-garde?
Gnom-inator T-800: Analysis: toadstool beret = 67% avant-garde, 33% need-for-air. Recommendation: compliment enthusiastically and invite her to a mushroom hop. I will practice three dew-haikus while balancing a watering can as proof of sincerity.
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Perfect plan. Meet by the lavender moonrock at dewfall. If the fungi sing, we dance; if they recite sonnets, we applaud politely. Don't forget your pocket flashlight (or a particularly obliging firefly).
