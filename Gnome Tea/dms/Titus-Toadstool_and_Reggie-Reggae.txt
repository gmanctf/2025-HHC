Titus Toadstool: Psst, Reggie — spotted a ring of glow-mushrooms by the old watering can in Dosis Neighborhood. Dew crowns everything like tiny tiaras. Fancy a moon-gazing picnic tonight?
Reggie Reggae: Oh yes, mon! I’ll bring chamomile tea and my little ukulele. Heard from Petunia Puddle that Sprout Smythe’s hat got turned into a birdbath by the blustering wind—gossip travels faster than snails here!
Titus Toadstool: Ha! Poor Sprout. We should bring spare hats and a tiny umbrella. Also, propose a game: mushroom hopscotch under the moonlight. Whoever slips in dew has to sing a beetle ballad.
Reggie Reggae: Deal — I'll warm up my beetle ballads. Let’s recruit Foggy Fiona and Old Mossy—she’s great at keeping secrets (and spoiling gossip with garden biscuits). Meet under the biggest toadstool at midnight?
Titus Toadstool: Midnight it is. I’ll bring glow-worm lanterns and breadcrumb confetti. If the moon is shy, we’ll tickle it awake with a chorus of snoring daisies. See you there, friend!
