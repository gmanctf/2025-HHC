Ferdinand Figgypudding: Psst Titus! Spotted Matilda Mintwhistle sprinkling glittering dew on the shroom beds at dawn — rumor has it she's training them to glow for moon-gazing. Also Harold Hopscotch wore three mushrooms as hats again. Shall we host a midnight tea-and-moon-gazing?
Titus Toadstool: Ferdinand! If Matilda's glow-moss works we'll need tiny sunglasses for the hedgehogs. Midnight tea-and-moon-gazing is perfect — I'll bring chamomile dew and a jar of firefly biscuits. Do you think the mushrooms will dance?
Ferdinand Figgypudding: They always do when I play the dandelion kazoo. I'll bring lily-pad lanterns and a wedge of moon-cheese for Eulalia's biscuit critiques. Also, watch out for Lottie Larkspur's pet snail — it snores like a thunderstorm and steals sugar cubes.
Titus Toadstool: Oh no, the sugar-snatching snail! I'll tuck the sugar into a pebble safe (very gnomely). And please remind Harold his mushroom-hats are charming but maybe skip the topiary parade — the hedgehogs tried to sit on him last time.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Deal. Meet at the stone sundial at midnight with comfy moss cushions. If the moon is shy we'll improvise a glow-moss talent show — prize: a tin of extra-sparkly dew. See you under the dew!
