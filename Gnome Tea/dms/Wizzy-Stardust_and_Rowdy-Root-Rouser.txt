Wizzy Stardust: Psst Rowdy! Spotted a glowing ring of mushrooms by the compost heap in Dosis — they blink like tiny lanterns. Think it's a sign for a midnight moon-gazing?
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Glorious! I say we throw a mushroom tea party and a dew-scraping contest. Also — did you see Petunia Prance wearing that thimble hat again? She tried to teach Basil Bold to do snail sprints this morning.
Wizzy Stardust: Oh, the thimble hat! Classic Petunia. Basil's snail sprints never end well (snails are slow and dramatic). Come at the first sliver of moon — I'll bring chamomile brewed in a robin's-thimble and a packet of glow-moss for ambiance. Mossy Myrtle will probably nap on a fern nearby.
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Perfect. I'll bring a tin of glittery dew-cups and my kazoo (for composter percussion). We can whisper gossip about Old Horace and his nightly conversation with the snails. Meet behind the hollyhock maze?
Wizzy Stardust: Behind the hollyhock maze it is. Moonlight, mushrooms, music, and whispering gossip — Dosis will never be the same. See you when the crickets change their tune!
