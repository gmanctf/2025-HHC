Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Barnaby! Dew on my boots this morning looked like a string of tiny lanterns—did you see Mabel dancing with the mushroom ring by the hydrangeas?
Barnaby Briefcase: Ahoy, Grizelda! I did—she insists the mushrooms taught her the polka. I checked my briefcase: emergency snacks, a moon-map, and a spare monocle. Picnic and moon gazing later?
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Only if we invite Percival—he owes us the inside scoop on the sprinkler rebellion. Also bring thyme tea; it's excellent for appreciating dew and quiet conspiracies.
Barnaby Briefcase: Percival can be bribed with a copper thimble and promises of toasted crickets. I'll pack thyme tea, blackberry scones, and a tiny umbrella (purely decorative, I swear). Where in Dosis?
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Top of the pumpkin patch, by the lantern beetle statue—excellent for moon reflections and discreet gossip. PS: Mabel swears the mushrooms hummed 'Happy Sproutday' at dawn.
Barnaby Briefcase: Perfect—pumpkin patch at nine. I'll bring a blanket, a compass for dramatic effect, and earplugs in case the mushrooms decide to hold a chorus rehearsal. See you under the moon!
