Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Psst, Chester! Dew on the nasturtiums this morning looked like tiny silver buttons — did you tell Marigold to stop teaching the mushrooms to polka at dawn? The moon will be scandalized.
Chester Cherryhat: Oh Grizelda, I did not! Marigold swears they're practicing for the nocturnal mushroom ball. I tripped over a toadstool and came home wearing a fungus as a beret.
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: A fungus beret? Splendid! Tonight I'll bring chamomile tea and a string of firefly lanterns for moon gazing. Also, Percy keeps borrowing my watering can and claims he is "just collecting dew samples"...
Chester Cherryhat: Brilliant — bring earplugs (Marigold hums in a key only roses can detect). I'll bake dandelion fritters and lure the gossipy sparrows away with breadcrumbs. Also, check the scarecrow's hat — it's been moonwalking again.
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Deal. If the scarecrow starts moonwalking toward the tulips, we stage an impromptu dance-off. Winner gets the last mushroom canapé. See you at twilight by the bluebell bench — don't forget your cherryhat!
