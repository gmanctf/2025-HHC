Bixby Jinglehat: Elderick! Spotted a ring of glow-moss by Mrs. Tansy's tulips — are the mushrooms rehearsing for the moon-gazing ball again? The dew looked like tiny lanterns.
Elderick Mossbeard: Ah, Bixby, the mushrooms never miss a rehearsal. I caught Whimsy Sprout pinning a dewdrop tiara on a chanterelle. If the snails learn to bow, we'll be in business.
Bixby Jinglehat: We should host a midnight mushroom tea — I'll bring honeyed petal biscuits and my little lantern hat. Maybe persuade Old Puddle to teach the snails a twirl?
Elderick Mossbeard: Brilliant. I'll brew moonlight chamomile and polish the toadstool bench. Rumor has it the robins are painting tiny invitation feathers as we speak.
Bixby Jinglehat: Perfect plan. Meet by the toadstool bench under the third fern at the bellflower chime. Don't forget your dew-catcher and your best gossip face!
