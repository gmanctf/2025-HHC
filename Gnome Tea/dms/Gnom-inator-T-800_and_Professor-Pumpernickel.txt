Gnom-inator T-800: Status: Mission Midnight Dew accomplished — observed three bioluminescent mushrooms behind the hydrangeas. Recommend immediate moon-gazing protocol and a small offering of mint leaves. My LED mustache is already twinkling.
Professor Pumpernickel: Splendid! Bring your LED mustache — Lady Spriglet insists on coordinated twinkle-waves. Also, tiny rumor: Old Bartholomew was seen teaching the snails to samba by the sundial. Apparently he's taken up marigold choreography.
Gnom-inator T-800: Acknowledged. I will bring mint, a thimble of chamomile tea, and a tiny flag for the mushrooms so they know which side to glow on. Shall we meet at the dew-collecting bench at moonrise? I calculate optimal stargazing at 3 twinkles past the big moon.
Professor Pumpernickel: Perfect. I'll bring the pocket telescope and a jar of fairy-sugar biscuits. Beware: Mrs. Tanglefoot may attempt to sell mushroom tea samples (very chatty, but her brew makes daisies dance). Also, the hedgehog snores in C-major — bring earplugs.
Gnom-inator T-800: Understood. Earplugs procured, biscuits secured, and I have issued a polite glare to the hedgehog's snore patterns. See you at moonrise for dew, gossip, and synchronized mushroom-flagging. Gnom-inator T-800 out (but I'll hug a fern on the way).
