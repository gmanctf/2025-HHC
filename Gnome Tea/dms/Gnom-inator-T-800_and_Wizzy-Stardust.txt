Gnom-inator T-800: Status report: Checking dew levels in Dosis Neighborhood. Observed three snails practicing tai chi on the rosemary. Proposal: moon-gazing assembly at the old toadstool tonight?
Wizzy Stardust: Ooo, a toadstool meetup! Also heard Mabel Mushroot swapped her purple cap for polka dots — scandalous. Shall I bring star-sparkle tea? It glows under moonlight.
Gnom-inator T-800: Affirmative: polka-dot anomaly logged. Bring star-sparkle tea and a mushroom-identification hat. I will bring a tiny blanket (thermodynamics preserved) and a playlist of cricket symphonies.
Wizzy Stardust: Cricket symphonies + thermodynamic blanket = perfect. Also, rumor: Old Basil the Basilisk is teaching young sprouts to roll in dew drops at dawn. Should we recruit them for the mushroom scavenger hunt?
Gnom-inator T-800: Recruitment protocol: 100% yes. More recruits increase probability of locating the legendary glowing chanterelle. Warning: Basil's rolling technique may cause soggy hats.
Wizzy Stardust: Soggy hats are a small price for chanterelle glory. Meet at the big dandelion in Dosis at half-moon. I'll bring a map, a magnifying glass, and extra hat-dryers. See you under the moon, fellow sentinel of soil!
