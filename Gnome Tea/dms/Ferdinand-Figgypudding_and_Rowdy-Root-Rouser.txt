Ferdinand Figgypudding: Rowdy! Sprinkled by dew this morning in the Dosis Neighborhood—my hat's soggy but my spirits are not! Did you hear Mrs. Tansy's mushrooms are glowing again? Perfect for moon-gazing tonight.
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Ferdinand! Glowing mushrooms? Count me in. I vote for a midnight mushroom tea party + dew-sip contest. Also, rumor has it Crispin Pinchpot boasted he can out-guzzle a snail—think that's gossip or scientific fact?
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Ha! Crispin vs. snail sounds like spectator sport. I’ll bring chamomile and the tiny teaspoons. Also, whispered that Ursula Giggletop plans to juggle toadstools—hope she doesn't accidentally launch them at Mrs. Petunia's petunia hat.
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Perfect. I'll recruit the hedgehog percussionists and borrow glow-lanterns from the blackberry bramble. If Ursula does launch a toadstool, we can moon-gaze through it for dramatic effect. Also—secret: I've got jam made from dewberries for the tea.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Dewberry jam? You're a hero, Rowdy. Meet at the old stone bench at dusk; bring blankets, a spare hat (for snails or hats-on-breakfast emergencies), and your loudest moon-hello. Dosis Neighborhood tradition continues!
