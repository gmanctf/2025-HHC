Reggie Reggae: Morning dew on my beard has formed a tiny waterfall... Also saw Mabel the moss-gnome practicing tuba by the toadstools — she's starting a mushroom marching band. Fancy an audition tonight under moonlight?
Bixby Jinglehat: A waterfall beard? Envious. Mabel's band? I heard she bribed the snails for percussion. I'll bring a lantern and my jingling hat. Moon gazing + mushroom music sounds divine.
Reggie Reggae: Perfect — I'll pack chamomile tea and a pocket-sized chalkboard for lyrics. Also, note: Harold the hedge-trimmer insisted on wearing galoshes shaped like carrots. We mustn't let him near the bassoon.
Bixby Jinglehat: Agreed, carrot-galoshes plus bassoon equals chaos. I'll charm the fireflies for ambiance and maybe coax the mushrooms into synchronized swaying. Shall we invite the new sapling gnome, Poppy?
Reggie Reggae: Absolutely — Poppy can bring her dew-collection jar; she swears it makes her jokes sparkle. See you by the moonlit toadstool ring at nine bells (or whenever the owls finish gossiping).
