Pip Sparkletoes: Wizzy! Dew beads in Dosis look like fairy marbles this morning — did you see Mr. Thimblepop balancing a mushroom cap on his head? I nearly spat out my chamomile!
Wizzy Stardust: Oh Pip, I did! He called it a 'mushroom crown' and winked at the moon. Speaking of moon, are we still on for moon-gazing behind the hollyhock tonight? I'll bring the glow-worm lanterns.
Pip Sparkletoes: Absolutely. Martha Mosshat promised scones but last time she hid them in a snail shell; I consider it an offering. Also, rumor has it Grumblebeard is training mushrooms to march. Should we invite them to the dew-dance?
Wizzy Stardust: Invite 'em! If Grumblebeard's fungi can do a conga, we'll have a full mushroom parade. I'll bring peppermint tea and a pocket telescope. Also, remind the sprinkler to behave — it tried to salsa last week.
Pip Sparkletoes: Perfect. Meet at the moonbeam bench at eight (or whenever the fireflies file their attendance). I'll bring tiny biscuits and a tiny umbrella — just in case the sprinkler salsa returns. See you, Stardust!
