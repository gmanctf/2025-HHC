Bixby Jinglehat: Psst Ferdinand! Spotted Mabel Polkadot practicing her mushroom ballet under the dew-kissed fern—she twirls like a dandelion in a drizzle. Fancy a moon-gazing picnic tonight?
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Oh Bixby, Mabel's ballet! I nearly dropped my trowel when I saw it. I'm in for moon-gazing — I'll bring lemon-thyme scones and a tiny lantern shaped like a snail shell.
Bixby Jinglehat: Perfect. Also heard from Petunia that Grubbins is secretly training snails for the annual pebble-rolling race. We should bet on the blue-rimmed snail; it's been doing hill sprints at dawn.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Ha! Grubbins and his snail Olympics. Let's invite the whole Dosis Neighborhood—bring mushrooms for the bonfire (charmingly non-flammable, I swear) and a jar of dew for the punch.
Bixby Jinglehat: Deal. I'll send invitations carved into acorn caps. Meet by the moonlit mushroom ring at seven bells. Don't forget your pointy hat of courage (and your napkin!).
