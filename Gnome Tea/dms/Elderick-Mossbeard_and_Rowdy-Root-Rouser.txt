Elderick Mossbeard: Rowdy! Moonlight dew this morning turned the marigolds into tiny lanterns — did you see Petunia Pipsqueak trying to balance a mushroom cap on her hat?
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Oh yes! I nearly spat out my compost tea laughing. Also heard Grindle the Hedge-Hopper is teaching snails how to waltz by the frog pond next Tuesday. Fancy joining the moon-gazing waltz?
Elderick Mossbeard: Count me in. I'll bring my binoculars (for tiny constellations) and a jar of dew cookies. Do you think the glowworms will RSVP, or are they still sulking over last month's leaf confetti incident?
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Glowworms are dramatic but can be bribed with extra nettle nectar. I'll handle the nettles if you handle the confetti apologies. Also, can we invite old Fen the Fence-Sitter? He has the best gossip about the new mushroom ring on Elm Lane.
Elderick Mossbeard: Fen loves a good mushroom mystery. I'll send him a polite thump on the post and tuck a tiny moon-map under his hat. See you by the dew-drenched marigolds at dusk — bring an extra umbrella for dancing snails!
