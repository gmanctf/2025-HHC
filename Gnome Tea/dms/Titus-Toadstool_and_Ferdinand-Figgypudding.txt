Titus Toadstool: Evening dew polished my hat—saw Matilda Mushroom practicing ballet on a toadstool! Fancy a moon-gazing picnic tonight by the lavender? I'll bring lemon tart and a jar of glowworms.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Glowworms? Splendid! Also, tiny bit of gossip: Greta Gravel traded her spade for a ukulele and serenaded the snails last Tuesday. They requested an encore.
Titus Toadstool: A ukulele-playing gardener is both scandalous and melodic! We'll invite Greta and Matilda. Heads-up: the mushroom circle insists on a strict 9pm caper for cap-dancing—never break a fungal vow.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Noted. I'll bring dew-resistant blankets and moonbeam biscuits. Shall we ask Old Basil to lead a lantern-lit shuffle, or will he insist on humming to the petunias again?
Titus Toadstool: Perfect. Meet at the fern arch at the first croak of the nightingale (or 8:30, if the nightingale snoozes). Dress code: caps polished, shoes mud-splattered by choice.
