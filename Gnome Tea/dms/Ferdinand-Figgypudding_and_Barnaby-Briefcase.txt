Ferdinand Figgypudding: Barnaby, spotted a ring of bioluminescent mushrooms by the sundial in Dosis! Think Petunia swapped her chamomile for glow-spores again?
Barnaby Briefcase: Oh dear, not Petunia's experimental brewing! I feared the umbrella-wearing geraniums would start glowing too. Shall we host a moon-gazing picnic to investigate—I'll bring dew-catchers and emergency crackers?
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Only if we recruit Olly Oakenbloom for harp accompaniment. Also important poll: mushroom hats or leaf lanterns as headwear? My toadstool topper is feeling competitive.
Barnaby Briefcase: Mushroom hats win by a spore... I mean, score. I'll bring ribbon and the Briefcase's emergency confetti. PS: gossip from the rose bed—Mr. Thistle Nap-Tilt has been politely rearranging our neighbors to face the moon every night.
Ferdinand Figgypudding: Brilliant. Meet under the hydrangea at dusk — I'll bring a jar for dew collection and a tiny telescope. If Mr. Thistle tries redecorating us, we'll blame it on the snails and serve extra biscuits.
