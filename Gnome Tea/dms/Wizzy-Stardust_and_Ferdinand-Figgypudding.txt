Wizzy Stardust: Psst — Ferdinand! Spotted a ring of bioluminescent mushrooms by the old pebble path. They looked like tiny lanterns and the morning dew on them sparkled like someone shook a jar of stardust. Also, rumor has it Gertrude braided a daisy into her hat and everyone is terribly impressed (and slightly jealous).
Ferdinand Figgypudding: No way — glowing mushrooms? That calls for a moon-gazing picnic! I'll bring chamomile in my fluted thermos. Tell Gertrude she can keep her daisy, but not her secret recipe for compost cookies. Also watch out for Mossy Marvin; he's been staking out 'the best moss patch' like it's a crown jewel.
Wizzy Stardust: Perfect — we'll do moonlight and chamomile. I propose a Dew-Drop Ring Toss to settle the moss-patch dispute: use acorn caps and the shiniest dewdrop you can find. Pipsqueak the hedgehog insists on being the official judge (he takes his job very seriously and wears a tiny monocle).
Ferdinand Figgypudding: A hedgehog judge? Splendid! I'll craft the acorn caps. Just a heads-up: Sir Cranklepince the snail has been lobbying for a melodramatic drum roll during ceremonies — we may need to bribe him with extra lettuce. Also, do not let Marvin near my watering can; last time he turned it into an impromptu fountain for his gnome topiaries.
Wizzy Stardust: Deal — I'll bring extra lettuce for Sir Cranklepince and a tiny sign that says 'Hands off Ferdinand's watering can' (in very polite script). Meet me at the willow by dusk; if the mushrooms twinkle, we crown a new Moss Monarch. See you under the moon, friend!
