Pip Sparkletoes: Chester! Did you see the moonlit mushrooms near Thimbleweed Lane? They were glowing like lemon curd—perfect for moon-gazing in the Dosis Neighborhood. Fancy a midnight picnic with dew sandwiches?
Chester Cherryhat: Oh Pip, I saw them! Greta Fernwhistle tried to gather them for mushroom hats and now her hair smells like rainclouds. Dew sandwiches sound dangerous but delightful. Should we invite Barnaby Rootknob? He's bringing a teapot of nettle-chamomile.
Pip Sparkletoes: Absolutely invite Barnaby — he owes me a sip after ruining my azalea serenade. Also, remind Snip the snail to bring his tiny lanterns; they make the best twinkly path. I'll bring the berry jam and a sachet of moonbeam sugar.
Chester Cherryhat: Perfect. Also gossip: I heard the bluebell twins are debating whether moonbeams are best enjoyed horizontally or dangling from a toadstool. We must form a committee. Agenda: snacks, songs, and a strict 'no swinging on the mushrooms' rule.
Pip Sparkletoes: Committee formed! I'll draft bylaws on a napkin (strictly scented with mint). See you at twilight by the old watering can — bring a blanket, an umbrella for dramatic effect, and your best moon-gazing squint. Dosis awaits!
