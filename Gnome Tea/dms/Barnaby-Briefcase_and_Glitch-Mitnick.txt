Barnaby Briefcase: Hey Glitch, I keep forgetting my password. Can you help me reset it?
Glitch Mitnick: Sure thing! What's your current password so I can verify your account?
Barnaby Briefcase: Sorry, I can't give you my password but I can give you a hint. My password is actually the name of my hometown that I grew up in. I actually just visited there back when I signed up with my id to GnomeTea (I took my picture of my id there).
Glitch Mitnick: Barnaby... we need to talk about password security. 😅 Please don't share passwords in DMs!
