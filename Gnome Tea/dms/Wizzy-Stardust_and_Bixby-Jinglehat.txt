Wizzy Stardust: Psst Bixby! Did you see Marigold Moonbeam trying to teach the mushrooms to do the conga last night? The dew kept clapping!
Bixby Jinglehat: Ha! I heard — she bribed them with glow-worm jam. I even brought a tiny tambourine made from an acorn. Also, are we still on for moon-gazing by the sundial Thursday?
Wizzy Stardust: Absolutely. I'll bring chamomile tea and my new telescope (it only points at fireflies when it wants attention). Maybe we invite Tully Tulip — he promised to bring snacks shaped like little hedgehogs.
Bixby Jinglehat: Perfect. I'll lay out the gingham leaf-blanket and recruit the snails as slow-motion ushers. Also, rumor: Griselda Gardenfork is knitting a hat for the moon. Should we vote it 'most fashionable celestial accessory'?
Wizzy Stardust: Vote: yes. But only if the mushrooms approve — they hold the honorary wardrobe committee. See you Thursday under dew-laced petals! Don't forget your hat bell.
