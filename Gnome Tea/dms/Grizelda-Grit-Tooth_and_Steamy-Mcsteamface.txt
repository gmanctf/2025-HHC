Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Did you see the mushroom ring behind the hydrangeas this morning? They held a tiny parade and left dew polka dots all down my boots. I swear Prunella taught them to curtsey.
Steamy Mcsteamface: I did! I brewed a foggy kettle and the steam made them do a jig. Also, scandal: Sir Sproutalot painted his hat glow-in-the-dark for moon gazing and the sparrows won't stop gossiping about it.
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Glow hats are perfect for a midnight mushroom waltz. Let's host a moon-gazing tea: honeyed dew biscuits, pebble xylophone by Mossy, and a polite curtsy contest for the fungi.
Steamy Mcsteamface: I'll bring my little steam whistle to signal the dance, though last time it fogged the mushrooms and they started reciting haikus. Should I warn Prunella about the snails? She might try to braid their shells again.
Grizelda Grit-Tooth: Meet me at the bluebell circle at moonrise. If the moon is shy we'll borrow Sir Sproutalot's hat-lantern. And bring spare boots—dew has a habit of stealing socks when it's feeling cheeky.
