Rowdy Root-Rouser: Psst Barnaby! Secret dew-raid at dawn? I heard Tilda Trowel swapped the blue mushrooms for marigolds and everyone's spooked.
Barnaby Briefcase: Oh dear—Tilda's at it again! I'll bring my briefcase of emergency compost and a monocle for moon-gazing diplomacy. What time's the raid?
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Sunrise-ish, when the snails are still on siesta. Also, rumor: the Fernway trio challenged Old Pebbler to a leaf-whistle duel. Fancy bringing snacks?
Barnaby Briefcase: Leaf-whistles and snacks—naturally. I'll pack crumpet crumbs and a tiny lantern. Do we moon-gaze after? My schedule clears up nicely for celestial scoffling.
Rowdy Root-Rouser: Perfect. Moon-gazing, gossip, and possibly persuading Tilda that blue mushrooms are a community art project. Meet at the hydrangea hedgehog? Bring an umbrella (for dew, not drama).
