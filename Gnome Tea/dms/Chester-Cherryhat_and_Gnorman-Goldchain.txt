Chester Cherryhat: Psst, Gnorman — I spotted Petunia Puddleboots braiding dew into her hat at dawn. She swore mushrooms are the new hatpins. Shall we start a mushroom-hat club for the Dosis Neighborhood?
Gnorman Goldchain: Ha! Petunia's always two sprouts ahead. I'm in if we make the meetings moon-gazing only and serve complimentary snail canapés. Also: glow-worm lanterns mandatory.
Chester Cherryhat: Moon-gazing it is. I'll bring the lanterns and a platter of tiny mint-leaf tea sandwiches. Quick question — is Fernwick really teaching moss yoga under the hydrangea, or is that just gossip from the turnip patch?
Gnorman Goldchain: Totally true — Fernwick's downward-fern is practically legendary. After yoga we should inspect the mushroom hats. And remind me to ask Thimble Tom why his mushrooms keep rearranging into smiley faces every morning.
Chester Cherryhat: Perfect. If the mushrooms are cheeky we'll let them be. Bring your gold chain for badge lighting and a tiny umbrella for dignified dew-dodging. See you under the moon, neighbor!
