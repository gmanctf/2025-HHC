URGENT - CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Tech Support Team & Mayor Dosis,

I'm writing to report what I believe may be a serious security breach in our neighborhood mail system. As the administrator of the dosismail account, I've noticed several concerning anomalies:

1. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS ATTEMPTS:

   - Messages appearing in my drafts folder that I didn't write
   - Tiny fingerprints on my keyboard (I know how that sounds...)

3. PHYSICAL SECURITY CONCERNS:

MOST CONCERNING: I found evidence that someone has been reading our resident email communications. They seem particularly interested in messages about:
