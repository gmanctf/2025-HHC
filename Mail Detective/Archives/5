URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear Esteemed Neighborhood Resident,

I am Prince Gnimothy Scamalot III, rightful heir to the Great Underground Gnome Kingdom of Atnas (you may have heard of our previous business ventures in 2015).

I am writing to you in DESPERATE need of assistance! Due to a recent coup in our kingdom, I have been exiled and am currently hiding in various garden centers throughout your neighborhood. 

Before my exile, I managed to secure FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS worth of premium bottle caps, thimbles, and tiny electronics in a secret underground vault. However, I cannot access these funds without the help of a trusted human partner!

Here is what I need from you:
1. Your bank account details (for the transfer)
2. Your home address (so I can verify you're real)
3. A small "processing fee" of $500 in gift cards
4. Your refrigerator model number (for... uh... security purposes)

In return, I will share 40% of the bottle cap fortune with you! That's TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS worth of bottle caps! Think of all the tiny pizzas you could buy!

I have already helped several of your neighbors with similar transactions:
- Old Pete received 50,000 bottle caps last week
- Granny Crumbleton got a lifetime supply of thimbles
- Sparky McGillicuddy now owns the world's largest collection of tiny screws

Please respond IMMEDIATELY as the Gnome Police are closing in on my location!

Your faithful partner in wealth,
Prince Gnimothy Scamalot III
Rightful Ruler of Underground Gnome Kingdom
Currently hiding behind the azaleas at 456 Oak Street

P.S. - Please ignore any reports of "missing Gnomes in Your Home decorations" in your area. These are unrelated to our business partnership and definitely not my army of loyal followers with their distinctive candy cane striped legs.
