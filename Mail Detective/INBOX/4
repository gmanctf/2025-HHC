URGENT NOTICE TO ALL DOSIS NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS

Due to the escalating reports of... *ahem*... "unusual small-scale activity" throughout our community, I am calling an EMERGENCY TOWN HALL MEETING for this evening at 7:00 PM in the Community Center.

AGENDA ITEMS:
1. Review of recent "tiny crime wave" reports
2. Discussion of mysteriously mobile garden decorations
3. Analysis of the "micro-food delivery incident"
4. Library break-ins (with improved organization?)
5. Strategy for handling what some residents are calling "The Gnome Situation"

I want to be clear: As your mayor, I take ALL citizen concerns seriously, no matter how... *cough*... creative they may sound.

We will have Officer Jingleberry present his full report, and I encourage ALL affected residents to bring evidence. This includes:
- Tiny footprint photos
- Miniature tool markings
- Any "borrowed" items that were mysteriously returned
- Security camera footage (no matter how blurry)

Refreshments will be provided by Granny Crumbleton (assuming her cookies don't get "liberated" again before the meeting).

Together, we will get to the bottom of these mysterious events and restore normal holiday peace to our beloved neighborhood!

Your dedicated public servant,
Mayor Duke Dosis
"Making Dosis Great Again, One Tiny Problem at a Time"

P.S. - If anyone has experience with... unusual... garden ornament behavior, please see me after the meeting. Asking for a friend.
