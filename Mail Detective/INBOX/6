ATTENTION ALL NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH MEMBERS,

We've received multiple reports of the strangest crime wave in Dosis Neighborhood history!

ITEMS REPORTED STOLEN:
- Mrs. Henderson's thimble collection (ALL 47 thimbles!)
- The Johnson family's refrigerator magnets (but only the alphabet ones)
- Several bottle caps from the recycling center
- Tiny screws from various household electronics
- One rubber band from the community bulletin board
- Multiple Christmas ornament hooks (but not the ornaments themselves!)

SUSPECT DESCRIPTION:
- Very small (approximately 6-8 inches tall)
- Wears pointed red hats
- Possibly travels in groups
- Makes tiny footprints in soft soil
- Last seen carrying what appeared to be miniature tools

This is either the work of the world's smallest crime syndicate, or we're dealing with something far more unusual. The evidence suggests organized activity, but the items stolen make NO sense whatsoever!

If you see any suspicious small figures, DO NOT APPROACH. Instead, call the Neighborhood Watch hotline immediately. 

Stay vigilant, stay safe, and maybe lock up your small household items just in case.

P.S. - Yes, I know this sounds crazy. No, I haven't been drinking eggnog on duty. These reports are REAL!
