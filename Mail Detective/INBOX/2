Fellow Garden Enthusiasts,

I've been gardening in this neighborhood for 47 years, and I've NEVER seen anything like what's happening now!

My old "Gnomes in Your Home" decorations... they keep moving around! I swear I left Gnorbert by the roses yesterday, but this morning he was next to the tomatoes! And Gnelda was supposed to be guarding the herb garden, but she somehow ended up in my tool shed!

At first I thought it was neighborhood kids playing pranks, but then I found tiny pickaxe marks in my soil and miniature ladder impressions by my fence. 

My wife says I'm losing my marbles, but I KNOW something fishy is going on. These "Gnomes in Your Home" decorations have been acting suspicious ever since I got them from that garage sale from the old Atnas Corporation warehouse clearance. You know, from their old holiday line with the candy cane striped legs?

Has anyone else noticed their lawn decorations moving around? I'm starting to think these aren't ordinary "Gnomes in Your Home" toys... I distinctly remember seeing those candy cane striped legs walking around!

Also, side note: whoever's been stealing my prize-winning turnips better stop it! I've got security cameras now (well, my grandson set up his old webcam), so I'll catch you red-handed!

Suspiciously yours,
Old Pete

P.S. - If you hear tiny pickaxes at night, THAT'S NOT NORMAL! Just saying.
