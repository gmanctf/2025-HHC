DEAR NEIGHBORS (AND POTENTIAL COOKIE THIEVES),

THIS IS AN EMERGENCY OF THE HIGHEST ORDER!!!

Someone (or something) has STOLEN my prize-winning gingerbread cookies right from my windowsill! I left them there to cool, and when I came back, ALL 47 OF THEM WERE GONE!

All that remained were tiny footprints... very small footprints... almost like they belonged to those old "Gnomes in Your Home" decorations with the candy cane striped legs, but that's RIDICULOUS because everyone knows those are just harmless holiday toys!

If you see anyone suspiciously crumb-covered or smelling like cinnamon and molasses, REPORT THEM IMMEDIATELY!

I'm offering a REWARD: One dozen fresh cookies to whoever returns my stolen batch!

Desperately yours,
Granny Crumbleton
Chief Cookie Coordinator
Dosis Neighborhood Baking Society

P.S. - I've also noticed my cooling racks keep getting mysteriously rearranged. Very strange indeed...
